# Discord Verification Bot

A modular, plugin-based Discord bot built with Discord.js v14+. Originally designed for user verification via dual screenshot submission and admin approval, now extended with a flexible plugin system that allows easy addition of new features and commands.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features

- **Plugin System**: Modular architecture allowing easy addition and removal of features
- **Dynamic Command Loading**: Commands are loaded from plugins at runtime
- **Plugin Configuration**: Each plugin can have its own configuration settings
- **Hot-reload Support**: Plugins can be reloaded without restarting the bot

### Verification Plugin Features

- **Dual Screenshot Verification**: `/verify` command requires 2 screenshots with character name and guild name parameters
- **Image Validation**: Automatic validation to ensure both uploads are valid image files (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)
- **Enhanced Display System**: Dual-embed display showing both screenshots clearly in verification channels
- **Admin Approval System**: Sends verification requests to designated channels with "Approve Verification" and "Deny Verification" buttons
- **Verification Denial System**: Moderators can deny verification requests with mandatory reason documentation
- **Resubmission Control**: Denied users must resubmit verification before being eligible for approval
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Only users with specified roles can approve verifications
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents users from submitting multiple verification requests
- **Auto-Response System**: Automatically guides users who send non-command messages to use `/verify`
- **Channel Auto-Moderation**: Automatically deletes non-command messages to keep verification channels clean
- **Smart DM Fallback**: Sends private DMs to users with public reply fallback if DMs are disabled
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Records verification events to both file system and Discord channels
- **Process Management**: PM2 integration for reliable bot hosting

## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** v16 or newer
- **Discord account** with server admin permissions
- **WSL or Linux shell** (if running on Windows)

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Choose one of the following installation methods:

#### Option A: NodeSource (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Option B: Node Version Manager (NVM)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
nvm alias default 18
```

### Step 2: Discord Bot Setup

1. **Create Application**

   - Navigate to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Click "New Application" and give it a name

2. **Configure Bot**

   - Go to the "Bot" tab
   - Click "Add Bot"
   - Copy the bot token (you'll need this later)
   - Enable "Server Members Intent" under Privileged Gateway Intents

3. **Set Bot Permissions**

   - Go to OAuth2 ‚Üí URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions:
     - Send Messages
     - Embed Links
     - Manage Roles
     - **Manage Nicknames** (for automatic nickname updates)
     - **Manage Messages** (for auto-deletion)
     - Read Message History
     - Use Application Commands

4. **Invite Bot to Server**
   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your Discord server

### Step 3: Project Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (or create project directory)
git clone <your-repo-url> discord-verification-bot
cd discord-verification-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 4: Configuration

The bot now uses a plugin-based configuration system. Create a `config.json` file based on `config.example.json`:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit the configuration with your values:

```json
{
  "token": "your_bot_token_here",
  "clientId": "your_application_id_here",
  "guildId": "your_server_id_here",
  "plugins": {
    "verification": {
      "enabled": true,
      "verifyChannelId": "channel_for_verification_requests",
      "verifyCommandChannelId": "channel_where_users_use_verify_command",
      "logChannelId": "channel_for_logs",
      "howToVerifyID": "channel_with_verification_instructions",
      "atreidesRoleId": "role_to_assign_verified_users",
      "verifierRoleIds": ["admin_role_id_1", "admin_role_id_2"],
      "approvalMessage": "‚úÖ Thank you for verifying! You have been approved.",
      "denialMessagePrefix": "‚ùå Your verification has been denied.",
      "debugMode": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Migrating from Old Configuration

If you're upgrading from the single-file version, use the migration script:

```bash
node migrate-config.js
# Review config.new.json and rename it to config.json
mv config.new.json config.json
```

### Step 5: Start the Bot

The bot now automatically deploys commands when it starts:

#### Development Mode

```bash
node index.js
```

#### Production Mode (with PM2)

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Start the bot
pm2 start index.js --name verification-bot

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Setup auto-start on system reboot
pm2 startup
```

## üéÆ Usage

### For Users

1. Use `/verify` command in the designated verification channel
2. **Upload 2 screenshots** as proof of verification (both required)
   - **Screenshot 1**: Primary verification image showing character and guild
   - **Screenshot 2**: Additional verification image for enhanced security
3. Provide your character name and guild name
4. Wait for admin approval
5. **Note**: Any non-command messages in the verification channel will be automatically deleted and you'll receive a private DM with guidance

#### Supported Image Formats

- PNG (.png)
- JPEG/JPG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

### For Admins

1. Monitor verification requests in the designated channel
2. **Review both screenshots** displayed in the verification embed:
   - Primary screenshot appears in the main embed
   - Secondary screenshot appears in a second embed below
3. Click "Approve Verification" button to approve users or "Deny Verification" to deny with reason
4. When denying, provide a mandatory reason in the popup modal
5. Check logs in the log channel or `verification_bot_logs.txt` file
6. Monitor auto-moderation events in the log channel

**Note**: Denied users must resubmit their verification before they can be approved.

## ü§ñ Auto-Moderation Features

### Message Guidance System

- **Trigger**: When users send any message that isn't `/verify` in the verification channel
- **Response**: Bot sends a private DM with guidance to use `/verify` command
- **Fallback**: If DM fails (user has DMs disabled), sends a public reply
- **Auto-Delete**: Original message is automatically deleted to keep channel clean

### Dual Screenshot Validation

- **File Type Checking**: Automatically validates that both uploads are valid image files
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid file types
- **Enhanced Display**: Two embeds showing both screenshots with clear labeling

#### Example Auto-Moderation Flow

1. User types: "How do I get verified?"
2. Bot sends private DM: "Please use the /verify command to begin the verification process. Check out the instructions in #how-to-verify."
3. Bot deletes the original message
4. Channel stays clean and organized

#### Example Verification Flow

1. User runs: `/verify character:PlayerName guild:GuildName screenshot1:[image1] screenshot2:[image2]`
2. Bot validates both images are valid formats
3. Bot creates dual-embed display showing both screenshots
4. Admins can review both images before making approval decision
