## üìã Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot framework, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** v16 or newer
- **Discord account** with server admin permissions
- **WSL or Linux shell** (if running on Windows)

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Choose one of the following installation methods:

#### Option A: NodeSource (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

#### Option B: Node Version Manager (NVM)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
nvm alias default 18
```

### Step 2: Discord Bot Setup

1. **Create Application**

   - Navigate to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Click "New Application" and give it a name

2. **Configure Bot**

   - Go to the "Bot" tab
   - Click "Add Bot"
   - Copy the bot token (you'll need this later)
   - Enable "Server Members Intent" under Privileged Gateway Intents

3. **Set Bot Permissions**

   - Go to OAuth2 ‚Üí URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions:
     - Send Messages
     - Embed Links
     - Manage Roles
     - **Manage Nicknames** (for automatic nickname updates)
     - **Manage Messages** (for auto-deletion)
     - Read Message History
     - Use Application Commands

4. **Invite Bot to Server**
   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your Discord server

### Step 3: Project Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (or create project directory)
git clone <your-repo-url> modular-discord-bot
cd modular-discord-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 4: Configuration

The bot now uses a plugin-based configuration system. Create a `config.json` file based on `config.example.json`:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit the configuration with your values:

```json
{
  "bot": {
    "token": "your_bot_token_here",
    "clientId": "your_application_id_here", 
    "guildId": "your_server_id_here"
  },

  "plugins": {
    "verification": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channels": {
        "verifyChannelId": "channel_for_verification_requests",
        "verifyCommandChannelId": "channel_where_users_use_verify_command",
        "logChannelId": "channel_for_logs",
        "howToVerifyID": "channel_with_verification_instructions"
      },
      "roles": {
        "atreidesRoleId": "role_to_assign_verified_users",
        "verifierRoleIds": ["admin_role_id_1", "admin_role_id_2"]
      },
      "messages": {
        "approvalMessage": "‚úÖ Thank you for verifying! You have been approved.",
        "denialMessagePrefix": "‚ùå Your verification has been denied."
      },
      "settings": {
        "debugMode": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Validating Your Configuration

Before starting the bot, you can check if your configuration is properly set up:

```bash
node check-config.js
```

This will validate all required settings and provide helpful feedback about any missing or incorrect values.

### Step 5: Start the Bot

The bot now automatically deploys commands when it starts:

#### Development Mode

```bash
node index.js
```

#### Production Mode (with PM2)

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Start the bot
pm2 start index.js --name verification-bot

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Setup auto-start on system reboot
pm2 startup
```

## üéÆ Usage

The bot framework comes with several plugins that provide different functionality. Below are examples using the included verification plugin.

### Verification Plugin Usage

#### For Users

1. Use `/verify` command in the designated verification channel
2. **Upload 2 screenshots** as proof of verification (both required)
   - **Screenshot 1**: Primary verification image showing character and guild
   - **Screenshot 2**: Additional verification image for enhanced security
3. Provide your character name and guild name
4. Wait for admin approval
5. **Note**: Any non-command messages in the verification channel will be automatically deleted and you'll receive a private DM with guidance

#### Supported Image Formats

- PNG (.png)
- JPEG/JPG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

#### For Admins

1. Monitor verification requests in the designated channel
2. **Review both screenshots** displayed in the verification embed:
   - Primary screenshot appears in the main embed
   - Secondary screenshot appears in a second embed below
3. Click "Approve Verification" button to approve users or "Deny Verification" to deny with reason
4. When denying, provide a mandatory reason in the popup modal
5. Check logs in the log channel or `verification_bot_logs.txt` file
6. Monitor auto-moderation events in the log channel

**Note**: Denied users must resubmit their verification before they can be approved.

## ü§ñ Auto-Moderation Features

### Message Guidance System

- **Trigger**: When users send any message that isn't `/verify` in the verification channel
- **Response**: Bot sends a private DM with guidance to use `/verify` command
- **Fallback**: If DM fails (user has DMs disabled), sends a public reply
- **Auto-Delete**: Original message is automatically deleted to keep channel clean

### Dual Screenshot Validation

- **File Type Checking**: Automatically validates that both uploads are valid image files
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid file types
- **Enhanced Display**: Two embeds showing both screenshots with clear labeling

#### Example Auto-Moderation Flow

1. User types: "How do I get verified?"
2. Bot sends private DM: "Please use the /verify command to begin the verification process. Check out the instructions in #how-to-verify."
3. Bot deletes the original message
4. Channel stays clean and organized

#### Example Verification Flow

1. User runs: `/verify character:PlayerName guild:GuildName screenshot1:[image1] screenshot2:[image2]`
2. Bot validates both images are valid formats
3. Bot creates dual-embed display showing both screenshots
4. Admins can review both images before making approval decision

## üîß PM2 Management Commands

| Command                        | Purpose                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `pm2 list`                     | View all running processes |
| `pm2 logs verification-bot`    | View live bot logs         |
| `pm2 restart verification-bot` | Restart the bot            |
| `pm2 stop verification-bot`    | Stop the bot               |
| `pm2 delete verification-bot`  | Remove bot from PM2        |
| `pm2 monit`                    | Monitor bot performance    |

   - Deny a verification with a reason and confirm the user receives a denial DM with the reason
   - Test with a user who has DMs disabled to verify warning logs appear

5. **Test Auto-Moderation**

   - Send a regular message in the verification channel
   - Verify you receive a private DM with guidance
   - Confirm the original message is deleted
   - Test with DMs disabled to verify public fallback

6. **Check Enhanced Logging**
   - Confirm logs show details about both uploaded screenshots
   - Verify log messages in the Discord log channel
   - Monitor auto-moderation events
   - Check file validation logging

## üìä Logging Events

### File Logging (`bot.log`)
The bot logs all events to `bot.log` in the root directory:

- **Bot startup/shutdown events**
- **Plugin loading/unloading**
- **Command deployment status**
- **Verification events** (marked with `[VERIFICATION]`):
  - ‚úÖ Successful verification approvals
  - ‚ùå Verification denials with reasons
  - üìù Nickname updates (success/failure)
  - üíå DM delivery status (success/failure)
  - üîç Debug information (when debug mode enabled)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration warnings and errors

### Discord Channel Logging
Only specific events are sent to the Discord log channel:

- ‚úÖ **Verification approvals**: `AdminName verified UserName at [timestamp]`
- ‚ùå **Verification denials**: `@Admin denied verification for @User. Reason: [reason]`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DM delivery failures**: `Failed to send denial DM to @User - user may have DMs disabled`

### Configuration Checking
Use the configuration checker to validate your setup:

```bash
node check-config.js
```

This tool will:
- Verify all required configuration values are set
- Check for missing channel IDs or role IDs
