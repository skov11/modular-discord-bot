### Step 3: Project Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skov11/modular-discord-bot.git
cd modular-discord-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 4: Configuration

The bot now uses a plugin-based configuration system. Create a `config.json` file based on `config.example.json`:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit the configuration with your values:

```json
{
  "bot": {
    "token": "your_bot_token_here",
    "clientId": "your_application_id_here",
    "guildId": "your_server_id_here",
    "enableUI": true,
    "uiPort": 3000,
    "uiAuth": {
      "enabled": false,
      "clientSecret": "your_discord_client_secret_here",
      "sessionSecret": "your_session_secret_here",
      "allowedRoleIds": ["admin_role_id_1", "admin_role_id_2"],
      "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback"
    }
  },

  "plugins": {
    "verification": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channels": {
        "verifyChannelId": "channel_for_verification_requests",
        "verifyCommandChannelId": "channel_where_users_use_verify_command",
        "logChannelId": "channel_for_logs",
        "howToVerifyID": "channel_with_verification_instructions"
      },
      "roles": {
        "verifiedRoleId": "role_to_assign_verified_users",
        "verifierRoleIds": ["admin_role_id_1", "admin_role_id_2"]
      },
      "messages": {
        "approvalMessage": "‚úÖ Thank you for verifying! You have been approved.",
        "denialMessagePrefix": "‚ùå Your verification has been denied."
      },
      "settings": {
        "debugMode": true,
        "screenshotCount": 2,
        "requireCharacterName": true,
        "requireGuildName": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Validating Your Configuration

Before starting the bot, you can check if your configuration is properly set up:

```bash
node check-config.js
```

This will validate all required settings and provide helpful feedback about any missing or incorrect values.

#### Verification Plugin Configuration Options

The verification plugin supports flexible configuration to adapt to different server needs:

**Screenshot Requirements** (`screenshotCount`):

- `0` - No screenshots required (text-only verification)
- `1` - Single screenshot required
- `2` - Dual screenshots required (default)

**Field Requirements**:

- `requireCharacterName` - Whether character name is required (default: `true`)
- `requireGuildName` - Whether guild name is required (default: `true`)

**Example configurations:**

```json
// Gaming server with full verification
"settings": {
  "screenshotCount": 2,
  "requireCharacterName": true,
  "requireGuildName": true
}

// Simple verification with minimal requirements
"settings": {
  "screenshotCount": 0,
  "requireCharacterName": false,
  "requireGuildName": false
}

// Single screenshot with character name only
"settings": {
  "screenshotCount": 1,
  "requireCharacterName": true,
  "requireGuildName": false
}
```

### Step 5: Start the Bot

The bot automatically deploys commands when it starts. If `enableUI` is set to `true` in config.json, the web management interface will start automatically on the configured port:

#### Development Mode

```bash
node index.js
```

The bot and web interface will start together. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

#### Production Mode (with PM2)

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Start the bot with UI
pm2 start index.js --name discord-bot

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Setup auto-start on system reboot
pm2 startup
```

### Step 6: Access the Web Interface

Once the bot is running, you can access the management dashboard:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured `uiPort`)
- **Authentication**: If enabled, you'll be redirected to Discord OAuth2 login
- **Features**: Real-time configuration, plugin management, and bot monitoring

For authentication setup, see [AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md](AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## üåê Web Management Interface

The bot includes a comprehensive web-based management interface for configuration and monitoring.

### Accessing the UI

When `enableUI` is set to `true` in your config.json, the web interface will be available at:

- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection on port 3001

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Configuration**: Modify bot and plugin settings with instant effects
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor bot connection status and performance
- **Plugin Management**: Enable/disable plugins and configure their settings
- **Hot-Reload**: Plugins reload automatically when configuration changes
- **Change Tracking**: Save button only activates when actual changes are made
- **Collapsible Sections**: Organize plugin configurations with expandable sections
- **Section Persistence**: Modified sections stay open after saving changes
- **Manual Plugin Reload**: Individual reload buttons for each plugin
- **Dark Theme**: Modern, eye-friendly interface optimized for extended use
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Using the UI

1. **Bot Settings**: Configure token, client ID, guild ID, and authentication preferences
2. **Plugin Configuration**:
   - Verification plugin with all settings (screenshot count, field requirements, messages)
   - Enable/disable plugins individually with toggle switches
   - Real-time validation and help text for all settings
   - Collapsible sections to focus on specific plugin configuration
3. **Actions**:
   - Save configuration changes (auto-activates when changes detected)
   - Manual plugin reload buttons for individual plugins
   - Restart bot (when needed for major changes)
   - Real-time bot status monitoring

### Production Deployment

The UI runs integrated with the main bot process when enabled:

```bash
# Start bot with UI (production)
pm2 start index.js --name discord-bot

# Or start without UI
# Set "enableUI": false in config.json first
pm2 start index.js --name discord-bot
```

## üéÆ Usage

The bot framework comes with several plugins that provide different functionality. Below are examples using the included verification plugin.

### Verification Plugin Usage

#### For Users

1. Use `/verify` command in the designated verification channel
2. **Upload 2 screenshots** as proof of verification (both required)
   - **Screenshot 1**: Primary verification image showing character and guild
   - **Screenshot 2**: Additional verification image for enhanced security
3. Provide your character name and guild name
4. Wait for admin approval
5. **Note**: Any non-command messages in the verification channel will be automatically deleted and you'll receive a private DM with guidance

#### Supported Image Formats

- PNG (.png)
- JPEG/JPG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

#### For Admins

1. Monitor verification requests in the designated channel
2. **Review both screenshots** displayed in the verification embed:
   - Primary screenshot appears in the main embed
   - Secondary screenshot appears in a second embed below
3. Click "Approve Verification" button to approve users or "Deny Verification" to deny with reason
4. When denying, provide a mandatory reason in the popup modal
5. Check logs in the log channel or `verification_bot_logs.txt` file
6. Monitor auto-moderation events in the log channel

**Note**: Denied users must resubmit their verification before they can be approved.

## ü§ñ Auto-Moderation Features

### Message Guidance System

- **Trigger**: When users send any message that isn't `/verify` in the verification channel
- **Response**: Bot sends a private DM with guidance to use `/verify` command
- **Fallback**: If DM fails (user has DMs disabled), sends a public reply
- **Auto-Delete**: Original message is automatically deleted to keep channel clean

### Dual Screenshot Validation

- **File Type Checking**: Automatically validates that both uploads are valid image files
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, WebP
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid file types
- **Enhanced Display**: Two embeds showing both screenshots with clear labeling

#### Example Auto-Moderation Flow

1. User types: "How do I get verified?"
2. Bot sends private DM: "Please use the /verify command to begin the verification process. Check out the instructions in #how-to-verify."
3. Bot deletes the original message
4. Channel stays clean and organized

#### Example Verification Flow

1. User runs: `/verify character:PlayerName guild:GuildName screenshot1:[image1] screenshot2:[image2]`
2. Bot validates both images are valid formats
3. Bot creates dual-embed display showing both screenshots
4. Admins can review both images before making approval decision

## üîß PM2 Management Commands

| Command                        | Purpose                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `pm2 list`                     | View all running processes |
| `pm2 logs verification-bot`    | View live bot logs         |
| `pm2 restart verification-bot` | Restart the bot            |
| `pm2 stop verification-bot`    | Stop the bot               |
| `pm2 delete verification-bot`  | Remove bot from PM2        |
| `pm2 monit`                    | Monitor bot performance    |
